# 🧙 Powerline-Wizard 🔮 

Powerline-Wizard is a modified version of Powerline-Icon theme for Oh My Bash 🧑‍💻

## ⚙️ INSTALLATION 

First, install Oh My Bash, you can find a short guide in the official repo [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Then, clone theme repo and move it to oh my bash themes dir. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tpCodeX/powerline-wizard.git

sudo mv ./powerline-wizard ~/.oh-my-bash/themes/
```

## ⚡ USAGE 
To set powerline-wizard, open `.bashrc` file with nano or any other text editor.

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

look for the line and change it to powerline-wizard


 `OSH_THEME="default_theme_x"` 
 

if you're doing right, it would look like this:

`OSH_THEME="powerline-wizard"` 

then, restart your terminal or run

```bash
source ~/.bashrc 
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT 

The only reason I'm creating this repo is because I haven't made a pull request to the Oh My Bash repo in order to officially add this theme yet. 

And even if I had, I'm not sure they would approve it, so if you want to use it, feel free to install it manually and give me a star 🫶
